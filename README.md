# Hand Gesture Detection
This project detects numeric hand gestures.

# Introduction
I have used basic Image Processing techniques for feature extraction from video frames and then used that to predict the gesture that has been made from 0-5. 

# Usage
Run as a usual ".py" script

# Problems Faced
Introduces some noise if the background color is close to skin color range. Gives best results if the background is extremely light or extremely dark toned.
